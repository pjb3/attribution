# Attribution

Attribution is a gem to allow you to define attributes for a Ruby object so that getters and setters will be defined that handle typecasting.  It also allows you to define associations between objects in an [ActiveRecord-style way][ar].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'attribution'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install attribution

## Usage

You can define attributes like this:

``` ruby
class Book
  include Attribution

  integer :id
  string :title
  decimal :price
  date :published_on
  boolean :ebook_available
  boolean :used
  float :shipping_weight
  time :created_at
  time :updated_at
  time_zone :time_zone

  has_many :chapters
end

class Chapter
  include Attribution

  integer :number
  string :title
  integer :page_number

  belongs_to :book
end
```

And then you can pass in a Hash or a String of JSON to initialize the object:

``` ruby
json = %{{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Rework",
  "price": "22.00",
  "published_on": "March 9, 2010",
  "ebook_available": "yes",
  "used": "no",
  "shipping_weight": "14.4",
  "created_at": "2013-02-20 05:39:45 -0500",
  "updated_at": "2013-02-20T05:40:37-05:00",
  "time_zone": "Eastern Time (US & Canada)",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "number": "1",
      "title": "Introduction",
      "page_number": "1"
    },
    {
      "number": "2",
      "title": "Takedowns",
      "page_number": "7"
    },
    {
      "number": "3",
      "title": "Go",
      "page_number": "29"
    }
  ]
}}

book = Book.new(json)
```

The object is populated based on the data, the values are converted into the type defined by the attribute:

    >> book.id
    => 1
    >> book.title
    => "Rework"
    >> book.price
    => #<BigDecimal:7f82dfe9d018,'0.22E2',9(18)>
    >> book.published_on
    => Tue, 09 Mar 2010
    >> book.ebook_available?
    => true
    >> book.used?
    => false
    >> book.shipping_weight
    => 14.4
    >> book.created_at
    => 2013-02-20 05:39:45 -0500
    >> book.updated_at
    => 2013-02-20 05:40:37 -0500
    >> book.time_zone
    => GMT-05:00 Eastern Time US  Canada

Also, the association is populated with an array of objects:

    >> book.chapters.size
    => 3
    >> book.chapters[2].page_number
    => 29

The reciprocating association is populated as well:

    >> book.chapters[2].book.title
    => "Rework"

You can access the values of all attributes as a hash:

    >> pp book.attributes
    {:id=>1,
     :title=>"Rework",
     :price=>#<BigDecimal:7f87db1f0b48,'0.22E2',9(18)>,
     :published_on=>Tue, 09 Mar 2010,
     :ebook_available=>true,
     :used=>false,
     :shipping_weight=>14.4,
     :created_at=>2013-02-20 05:39:45 -0500,
     :updated_at=>2013-02-20 05:40:37 -0500,
     :time_zone=>(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)}

You can also add any arbitrary metadata to any attribute:

``` ruby
class Book
  include Attribution

  decimal :price, :required => true, :doc => "Price in USD", :whatever => "why not?"
end
```

And retrieve that metadata any time:

    >> Book.attributes
    => [{:required=>true, :doc=>"Price in USD", :whatever=>"why not?", :name=>:price, :type=>:decimal}]

Attribution also has a module to make any object act more like a model:

``` ruby
require 'attribution/model'
class Book
  include Attribution::Model
end
```

By using `Attribution::Model`, your object will:

* Have an id that is an integer
* Implementation for equality and hash based on the id
* Have a created_at that is a time
* Have an updated_at that is a time
* Include [ActiveModel::Validations][am]

You can define validations in the standard way you do when using `ActiveModel::Validations`:

``` ruby
class Book
  include Attribution::Model

  belongs_to :author

  string :title

  validates :title, :presence => true
  validates :title, :uniqueness => true
  validates :title, :format => { :with => /^\w/, :message => "must start with a letter" }
end
```

Or, more concisely, you can define the validation as part of the attribute definition:

``` ruby
class Book
  include Attribution::Model

  belongs_to :author

  string :title, :required => true,
                 :unique => true,
                 :format => { :with => /^w/, :message => "must start with a letter" }
end
```
